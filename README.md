Chrome extension for controlling [Spotify Web Player](https://play.spotify.com)

Install the Chrome Web Store:
[Chrome web store link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gkmfagbigbkgjbbphlemmafhjabeofek)

It asks for permission to access play.spotify.com so that it can be
controled from the extension's popup.

You can grant additional permission to access all websites so that
"spotify:*" links will be captured by the web player.

See my [blog post](http://kyle.graehl.org/chrome,/extension,/development/2013/08/18/chrome-extension-rants.html)
about some of the fancy implementation tricks used in this extension.

enjoy :-)
